      <description>Clarity is something which we all strive for, we crave for it, we are encouraged to have it. Irony though has its own part to play in all of this, finding clarity lands us into situations which are cryptic to us and in all this puzzlement somewhere we loose our goal towards things. Things start to get muddled up, red flags start showing up in your head, we then are filled with fear, fear of not having stuff planned out, fear of failure, fear of being judged.</description>
