        <p>Clarity is something which we all strive for, we crave for it, we are encouraged to have it. Irony though has its own part to play in all of this, finding clarity lands us into situations which are cryptic to us and in all this puzzlement somewhere we loose our goal towards things. Things start to get muddled up, red flags start showing up in your head, we then are filled with fear, fear of not having stuff planned out, fear of failure, fear of being judged.</p>
<p>The clear water in this picture does not come any close to our muddied and dark uncharted waters in our mind. To explain this notion of clarity we need to first bury ourselves in our making. Our existence comprises of three things : mind, body, intellect. Our body is created by the five elements of nature and it will get destroyed and get back to its original form. The mind is our brain but in action. This means that our mind has thoughts due to the constant signals running in our brain&rsquo;s neural network. The thoughts can change into thinking which is the constant linking of thoughts. The last, but not the least, the pride of Homo Sapiens is its intelligence. This part has cognitive abilities, which helped us develop civilisation, technology, and much more. Our intellect has the ability to make connections, decisions and evaluate circumstances.</p>
<p>When these three work together and are in perfect harmony , we have satisfaction with how things are flowing. As soon as one of the aspects dwindle, and lo and behold that is when the constant fights begin. For example, when your body isn&rsquo;t fit, you cannot carry out intellectual work with full potential, similarly if your mind doesn&rsquo;t have any intention on giving up a set mindset which may or may not be right, you are in constant fight with your body and intellect. Overtime, when this fight becomes constant and we cannot contend anymore, our mind wins , our belief system wins. This might also be a reason why we have so many extremists in our society.</p>
<p>Our vacillating existence and motive can never be cleared up if we cannot align these three things. The three pillars form our structure, our life; if even one of them falls or tilts our whole structure might tilt. When people talk about being clear, I feel first our belief system should perceive the environment around us and then give its final verdict. Our thoughts are never positive or negative , just right or wrong that to applicable only to us. Clarity in our living, can only help us live a more fulfilled life. When you have this kind of state, even though bad situations may arise , you will always be calm and in peace, and wade your way through it.
Our mind is a swindler, so beware of what you feed to it, otherwise it might give you attractive lucrative schemes and you will end up of falling for it . But the consequences will be severe, you might have a great fall, maybe hit your rock bottom.</p>
<p>This is one of the places where I want to start my work, I want to regrout my old tiles and learn from this process. I realise this journey is meant to be enjoyed , and it can happen if you find &ldquo;the clarity&rdquo;.</p>
